# Instruction
1. Move these files into where your `krnl` file is located.
    - `mv *.sh /usr/src/proj1/`
2. Call `sudo ./main`
    - If you call `ls` and files are not green, then it means your system did not recognize them as exectueable:
    - call `chmod +x *.sh` to tag all files ending with `.sh` as exectueable and try `sudo ./main` again.
