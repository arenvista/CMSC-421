# How much experience have you had with virtual machines before this class?  
I have some experience testing operating systems in a windows setup via virtalbox. 
I have some experience compiling the linux kernel and adding in small syscalls to boot, I tested the compiled vmlinux and bzImage on a linux system via QEMU.  
# How much experience have you had with debugging code before this class?  
Expierence in prior course work and personal projects. Largely using GDB/Geff. I have player around debugging kernels w/ GDB. 
# What do you fine helpful when debugging error messages?
Stack track, moving through memory addresses, and watchpoints are my most commonly used approaches when using GDB. 
I find added catch, throw, and excepts to help in tracking output. 
If the error is propigated downstream of an earlier commit I'm quite fond of using `git bisect` to find the last stable version and cat'ing out the differences between commits. 
These are the usual stratigies I employ when debugging as a generality.
